<p>It was once believed that Mexican fod was great at giving #2, but did you know #3 and #4 can be achieved with Mexican food. Here to testify is long time pooper Joe Smith.</p>
<p>Joe once said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I’m stumped at the amount of poop someone can have after Mexican fod. Today I did a Mexican #2. It was the greatest poop the world has ever seen. On the bus, the orangeman convinced me #2s and #3s were strictly forbidden on the bus, probably because it gets everywhere. Anyhow, that doesn’t concern me because I wear a napkin at all times.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now more tourists are concerned but when interviewing locals they say;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Just use a napkin in case it gets over the front of your shirt.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it seems the consensus is to just use a napkin. Who would have thunk. Would you have thunk it? Take our <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/ellievhall/which-of-jesuss-disciples-are-you"><em>How Low is your IQ</em></a> Buzzfeed quiz to find out.</p>
<p>Now to end off our research, we will consult our Mexican genius, Goblin Correspondent™ Stain. He claims that all you need to do is use:<br>

to remove all gut abnormalities.</p>
